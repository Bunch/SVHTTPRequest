h1. SVHTTPRequest

SVHTTPRequest is a simple and extremely straightforward alternative to bulky ASIHTTPRequest. It is blocked-based, uses NSURLConnection and its only 3rd party dependancy is the blazing fast "JSONKit":https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit (included in package).

SVHTTPRequest features:

* straightforward singleton convenience methods
* completion block handler called with parsed JSON
* support for basic authentication request signing
* talks with @setNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible@ (can be disabled)

h2. Installation

* Drag the @SVHTTPRequest/SVHTTPRequest@ folder into your project. 

h2. Usage:

SVHTTPRequest was designed to be as most straightforward as possible:

<pre>
[SVHTTPRequest GET:@"http://api.twitter.com/1/users/show.json"
        parameters:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"samvermette" forKey:@"screen_name"]
        completion:^(NSObject *response) {
            NSLog(@"%@", response);
        }];
</pre>

By now you've probably guessed how to make a POST request.


h3. Signing requests for basic auth

SVHTTPRequest allows you to easily sign your requests for "basic authentication":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication through the same convenience methods:

<pre>
[SVHTTPRequest POST:address
         parameters:parameters 
           username:username
           password:password
         completion:^(NSObject *response)];
</pre>

h3. Cancelling requests

It's important that you cancel requests that the user isn't waiting for anymore, for instance when he leave a view. All of SVHTTPRequest class methods return pointers to their own instances. Use it to cancel the request if needed:

<pre>
SVHTTPRequest *request = [SVHTTPRequest GET:@"http://api.twitter.com/1/users/show.json"
                                 parameters:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"samvermette" forKey:@"screen_name"]
                                 completion:^(NSObject *response) {
                                     NSLog(@"%@", response);
                                 }];
   
[request cancel];
</pre>
