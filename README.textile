h1. SVHTTPRequest

SVHTTPRequest is a simple and extremely straightforward alternative to bulky ASIHTTPRequest. It is blocked-based, uses NSURLConnection and its only 3rd party dependancy is the blazing fast "JSONKit":https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit (included in package).

SVHTTPRequest features:

* straightforward singleton convenience methods
* completion block handler
* response is automatically parsed (if applicable) and forwarded to completion block
* support for basic authentication request signing
* talks with @setNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible@

h2. Installation

* Drag the @SVHTTPRequest/SVHTTPRequest@ folder into your project. 

h2. Usage

(see sample Xcode project in @/Demo@)

SVHTTPRequest was designed to be the most straightforward possible:

<pre>
[SVHTTPRequest GET:@"http://api.twitter.com/1/users/show.json"
        parameters:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"samvermette" forKey:@"screen_name"]
        completion:^(NSObject *response) {
            NSLog(@"%@", response);
        }];
</pre>

By now you've probably guessed how to make a POST request.

h3. Cancelling requests

Make sure you cancel requests for which the user isn't waiting on anymore:

<pre>
SVHTTPRequest *request = [SVHTTPRequest GET:@"http://api.twitter.com/1/users/show.json"
                                 parameters:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"samvermette" forKey:@"screen_name"]
                                 completion:^(NSObject *response) {
                                     NSLog(@"%@", response);
                                 }];
   
[request cancel];
</pre>

h3. Connection errors

Requests that fail will report back to the completion block with a @nil@ response object. You can also use the response object to detect errors, depending on the type of call you're making (for instance you were expecting a JSON object and it's not, or if the server itself is providing you with error descriptions).

h3. Signing requests for basic auth

You can easily sign your requests for "basic authentication":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication using similar convenience methods:

<pre>
[SVHTTPRequest POST:address
         parameters:parameters 
           username:username
           password:password
         completion:completionBlock];
</pre>
